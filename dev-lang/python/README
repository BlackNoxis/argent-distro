So, hello!
Good that you opened this file.
Python here is a verbatim copy of the portage version,
with just one exception: IUSE=tk is disabled and not
even redirected to python-tk. This way we can satisfy
the use deps constraints on our chroots and then rewrite
the dependency to point to dev-lang/python-tk
